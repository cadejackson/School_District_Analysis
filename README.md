# <u>School District Analysis</u>

## <u>Project Overview</u>
The school board has suspicion that the grades from Thomas High School have been altered, specifically the reading and math scores for 9th graders.  The objective of this project is to remove the 9th grade scores from the dataset and recalculate the results to observe how the results change.

## <u>Results</u>

The project started by reading the school and student, performing some data cleaning and then merging the datasets together for further analysis.  I then replaced math, reading, and overall passing percentages with "nan" for Thomas High School in order to re-calculate the statistics for 10th - 12th grades.
